Instructions:
=============

Open your playwright project in VS Code

Launch VS Code.

Create a new folder (e.g., JS-Exercises) at root level of your playwright project.

Inside that folder, create a new file:
=======================================
<yourname>-js-solution.js

Code your solution in file.

To execute the .js code:
=========================
Open a terminal and cd to your folder (JS-Exercises)
Run the command:
node yourname-js-solution.js

Exercise 1 – Variables & Concatenation
==================

Define variables for studentName, subject, and marks.
Print a welcome message that concatenates the studentName and subject.

Exercise 2 – Operators
==================

Use arithmetic operators to:
    Give random mark to a student and print the marks.
    Add bonus marks (marks + 5) and print the new marks.
    Show difference (100 - marks) and print it.

Exercise 3 – Equality & Comparison
==================

Check if marks are exactly equal to 50 using == and === operators. Print the results.
Compare if marks are greater than 40 and less than or equal to 100. Print the results.

Use a logical operator (&&, ||) to combine conditions.

Exercise 4 – Data Types
==================

Create variables of different data types: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and an array. Assign appropriate values to each.
Print the type of each variable using typeof.

Exercise 5 – Conditional Statements
==================

Use if-else to assign grades based on marks (A, B, C, Fail).

Use a switch statement on the subject variable to print a subject-specific motivational message.

Exercise 6 – Functions
==================

Create a function calculateGrade(marks) that returns the grade.
Call this function and print the result for the student.

Exercise 7 – Loops
==================

Use a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 5 with the student’s name.
Use a while loop to count down from marks to 0 in steps of 10.
Use a do-while loop to ensure at least one motivational message is printed, even if the marks are 0.

Completion Criteria:
======================

By the end of this 15 minutes exercise, you should have practiced:

1. Declaring and concatenating variables.
2. Using arithmetic, increment/decrement, equality, comparison, and logical operators.
3. Creating variables of all major data types.
4. Writing if-else and switch statements.
5. Writing and calling a function.
6. Using for, while, and do-while loops.
